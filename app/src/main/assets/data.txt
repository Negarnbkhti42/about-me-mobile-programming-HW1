My name is Negar Nobakhti, 22 year old student at sharif university of technology, studying computer engineering. I'm originaly from Khuzestan, a province in the south of Iran. I recently moved to Tehran to pursue my education.
So why did i choose to study computer engineering? I have no solid answer to that. Maybe at the beginning it was more about entering a field with a good carrer opportunity for women, though I desired to study engineering from the beginning. I love the problem solving notion of this field; But now I can't imagine myself studying anything else. 
I have chosen Frontend development as my field of speciality. I dont' have much hand in design, but I love creating interfaces, or any interactable tool of that kind.
